                    Transitioning from a career as a Mechanical Design Engineer to becoming a Full-Stack Software Developer, I've embarked on a transformative journey, bridging the gap between the physical and digital worlds. I have experience in programming languages such as C#, Python, Ruby, HTML, CSS and JavaScript with a particular focus on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, where worked with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js).. My dedication to continuous learning drives me, and I'm genuinely excited to explore new technologies and languages as I continue my journey in software development.

                    Beyond my professional journey, I run an e-commerce boutique specializing in stylish home and garden items, inspired by my love for indoor plants. I enjoy badminton, traveling, and strategic board games, like Settlers of Catan. Photography is another passion of mine, capturing moments that tell stories. These interests not only balance my life but also fuel my creativity and problem-solving skills, which I apply in both work and personal endeavors.
