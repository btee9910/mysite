          Transitioning from a career as a Mechanical Design Engineer to
          becoming a Full-Stack Software Developer, I've embarked on a
          transformative journey, bridging the gap between the physical and
          digital worlds. I have experience in programming languages such as C#,
          Python, Ruby, HTML, CSS and JavaScript with a particular focus on
          HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, where I have worked with the MERN stack
          (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). My dedication to continuous
          learning drives me, and I'm genuinely excited to explore new
          technologies and languages as I continue my journey in software
          development.

          Beyond my professional journey, I enjoy badminton, traveling, and
          strategic board games like Settlers of Catan. I’m also passionate
          about photography, often capturing moments that tell meaningful
          stories. In my spare time, I love working on DIY projects and hands-on
          builds, which allow me to apply my problem-solving skills in creative,
          practical ways. These interests not only balance my life but also fuel
          the curiosity, focus, and adaptability I bring to software
          development.
